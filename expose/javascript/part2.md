1. 3, the length of price list is 3
2. 150, discountPrice is 150 when the loop finished
3. 150, finalPrice is 150 when the loop finished
4. [50, 100, 150], each value is halved and pushed in the array 
5. Error, i is not defined in that scope
6. Error, discountPrice is not defined in that scope
7. Error, finalPrice is not defined in that scope
8. [50, 100, 150], each value is halved and pushed in the array 
9. Error, i is not defined in that scope
10. 3, length is defined in the same scope
11. [50, 100, 150], each value is halved and pushed in the array 
12.
    A. student.name
    B. student['Grad Year']
    C. student.greeting()
    D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name
    E. student.courseLoad[0]
13.
    A. '32', + with string causes string concatenation.
    B. 1, - causes type coercion to numbers.
    C. 3, null is treated as 0.
    D. '3null', + with string causes string concatenation.
    E. 4, true is treated as 1.
    F. 0, both null and false are treated as 0.
    G. '3undefined', + with string causes string concatenation.
    H. NaN, - causes type coercion to numbers, and 3 - NaN = NaN
14.
    A. true, comparison with number treats both side as number, 2 > 1
    B. false, comparison with both string goes in lexicographical order, '2' > '1'
    C. true, comparison with number treats both side as number, 2 == 2
    D. false, === means strict comparison.
    E. false, true is treated as 1, 1 != 2
    F. true, Boolean(2) is true, true === true.
15. === checks both value and type, while == loosely check value.
